# CISSSCO.github.io

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built and hosted
using GitHub Pages.

The site is intentionally minimal and terminal-driven. Rather than
presenting information through traditional navigation or UI components,
all interaction happens through a command-line style interface.

The goal is not to simulate a terminal, but to **use terminal
metaphors** to express how I think about systems, tools, and workflows.

# Design Philosophy

This project follows a few core principles:

-   **CLI-first interaction** The terminal is the primary interface.
    Users explicitly request information by typing commands.

-   **No frameworks** The site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and
    minimal JavaScript. This keeps the code readable, debuggable, and
    long-term maintainable.

-   **Progressive enhancement** The site works without JavaScript for
    layout and styling. JavaScript only adds interaction, not structure.

-   **Explicit behavior** There is no automatic navigation, routing, or
    hidden logic. Commands map directly to content.

-   **Restraint over flash** Visual design is subtle and
    terminal-inspired. No animations, gimmicks, or unnecessary effects.

# Interaction Model

The site behaves like a simple REPL:

-   The terminal input is always visible
-   Content is rendered **above** the terminal
-   Commands print output instead of navigating pages
-   The `clear` command resets the output buffer
-   A short hint is shown on load and after clearing

This mirrors how real command-line tools behave.

# Commands

The following commands are supported by the terminal interface. Commands
are intentionally minimal and explicit.

## help

Displays a list of available commands with short descriptions.

This is the primary discovery mechanism for users. No content is shown
automatically without user interaction.

## about

Displays a system-style overview of who I am, inspired by tools such as
`neofetch`, but focused on professional identity rather than system
metrics.

The output includes:

-   Role and technical focus
-   Preferred operating system
-   Primary programming languages
-   Links to external profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn)

This command represents the **identity entry point** of the site.

## projects

Displays an overview of selected projects with brief descriptions and
links to their respective source repositories.

Projects are presented as terminal-friendly output rather than cards or
visual sections, emphasizing clarity over presentation.

## philosophy

Describes how I approach software development, learning, and open
source.

This includes:

-   Preference for Linux and system-level understanding
-   Open-source values and community contribution
-   Teaching and mentoring mindset
-   Interest in literate programming and customization

This command explains **how I think**, not just **what I build**.

## uses

Lists the tools, environments, and workflows I commonly use.

This includes:

-   Linux-based environments
-   Preference for window managers over desktop environments
-   Programming languages and scripting tools
-   Editors and documentation workflows

The intent is to provide context about my daily working environment.

## clear

Clears all rendered output from the page.

After clearing, a short hint is displayed prompting the user to type
`help` to get started again.

This mirrors the behavior of clearing a terminal screen.

# Command Architecture

Commands are implemented as string keys mapped to content blocks.

-   No generic argument parser is used
-   Commands are matched explicitly
-   Output rendering is separated from command handling logic

This design keeps the system simple and easy to extend while avoiding
unnecessary abstractions.

# Content Organization

All rendered content lives in a single registry:

-   `js/content.js` contains declarative HTML fragments
-   The terminal engine does not know about page structure
-   Styling is handled entirely through CSS classes

This separation allows content to evolve independently of interaction
logic.

# Styling Approach

The visual style is inspired by terminal environments:

-   Dark background
-   Semantic colors (titles, keys, values, links)
-   No card layouts or shadows
-   Typography-first design

Colors are used to convey meaning, not decoration.
